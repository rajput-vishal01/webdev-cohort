# TypeScript Syllabus

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, bringing powerful benefits to your development workflow:

- **Static Typing:** Catch errors during development rather than at runtime, reducing bugs.
- **Enhanced Tooling:** Enjoy autocompletion, type checking, and refactoring support in modern IDEs.
- **Scalability:** Write cleaner, more maintainable code—perfect for large-scale applications.
- **Advanced Features:** Leverage interfaces, generics, enums, and more for robust code design.
- **Ecosystem Support:** Tap into a thriving community and a wide range of TypeScript-compatible libraries.

Learning TypeScript equips you to build reliable, scalable applications with confidence.
